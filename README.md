# CSharp_Foundations

### Summary.
This folder, ```CSharp_Foundations```, explores C#.  There are five exercises that have a range of complexity.  Of the five exercises, three of them stem from work associated with [C# Fundamentals with Visual Studio 2015](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/c-sharp-fundamentals-with-visual-studio-2015) by Scott Allen.  The remaining exercises were to determine the path of files of a given folder and to manipulate the output data.

### Exercises.
There are five exercises.  Below, are the file names and a brief summary of each exercise. MiniProject1 and MiniProject2 will be covered in more detail in the next two sections.
- ```01-Hello``` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Basic "hello world" run from command line.
- ```02-Hello``` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Program asks for user inputs and determines the sleep status of the user via conditional statement.
- ```03-Grades``` &nbsp; &nbsp; A gradebook, as demonstrated by the C# Fundamentals with Visual Studio 2015.
- ```MiniProject1```Program that finds all file paths, the words in each text file, and the location of these words in the file.
- ```MiniProject2```Program that enumerates all occurances of a word of text files in a given path.

#### MiniProject1.
Task: Given a folder, display the path of `txt` files.  With user input, select the path to display full text of that file.  From the listing of the text, select the desired word.  The output will be the index/indices where that word shows up in the text of the file. Screenshots are included to see the output.
